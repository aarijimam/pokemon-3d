A 3D pokemon game on Unity for a semester project

•	The game has a main character that can be moved using WASD buttons and you can look around by moving the mouse. 

•	The world has several buildings and vegetation. While passing through the tall grasses, there is a chance to encounter a wild Pokémon. 

•	You can either “Fight”, “Catch” or “Run from” the Pokémon. You can choose the actions by using the arrow keys and confirm your selection by pressing the ‘Z’ key. 

•	We can catch the Pokémon by pressing ‘T’ on the keyboard.

•	Upon collecting 10 Pokémons, the game is completed, and the user is shown the end screen.
